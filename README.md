## Description

This is a gallery project dedicated to my best friend, Morton. 

Like every project, I started with a to-do list and made sure each part of the assignment was addressed. The base mode goals were pretty straightforward and I was able to get that all done Friday night with no issues. 

Saturday I got my database set up and refactored as necessary to get that running. Once that was in place, setting up the form and the delete function were easy. 

At that point I started watching some Material UI tutorials for the stretch goal. I was happy I did because its a pretty great library and spent most of the day experimenting and working with it. I hit a few snags along the way but have a better understanding of how to incorporate css styling with the material styling. Normally I use classnames to style but found id's worked better to override MUI. Next time I want to spend more time learning themes with MUI. It seems like a more streamlined way to edit the styles. 

Hope you enjoy getting to know my dog Morty!
